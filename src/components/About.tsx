                I’m drawn to problems that don’t come with clear instructions, where user
                needs, technical constraints, and business goals pull in different
                directions. In those spaces, I focus on understanding what actually
                matters before jumping to solutions.

            <p>
                My approach is grounded in evidence. I ask questions, study how systems
                behave, and use data to separate symptoms from root causes. Sometimes
                that means analyzing workflows and patterns. Other times it means
                prototyping, testing assumptions, or building something tangible to
                learn faster. What matters most to me is clarity, turning vague
                challenges into decisions that move things forward.

                I’ve worked across analytics, technical execution, and stakeholder-facing
                roles, which has shaped how I think. I’m comfortable diving deep into
                details when needed, but I care just as much about stepping back,
                communicating tradeoffs, and aligning people around a direction. That
                balance is where I do my best work.

                I’m early in my career, but intentional. I’m looking for environments
                where I can take on real responsibility, learn quickly, and contribute
                to meaningful problems, especially where data and thoughtful execution
                are central to building better outcomes.
